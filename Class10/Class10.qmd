Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

# Write a function to fix this non-numeric table. 
```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x){
  as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
}

PDB.df <- apply(PDB, 2, rm.comma)
PDB.df
```

# Add original row names 
```{r}
rownames(PDB.df) <- rownames(PDB)
PDB.df
```

Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

93% 

```{r}
x <- sum(PDB.df[,1:2])
y <- sum(PDB.df[,1:6])
(x/y)*100

totals <- apply(PDB.df, 2, sum)
totals/totals["Total"]*100
```

Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

86%

```{r}
x <- sum(PDB.df[1,])
y <- sum(PDB.df[1:6,])
(x/y)*100

totals <- apply(PDB.df, 1, sum)
sum(PDB.df[1,])
sum(PDB.df[1:6,])
x/y
```

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?




Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen is only one 1A and the resolution for this is 2A. 

Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

H0H - 308.


Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198

Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
HOH

Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2

Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
msa.

Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 
bio3D-view.

Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?
TRUE.

```{r}
#library(bio3d)
#aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```

```{r}
#install.packages("bio3d")
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("BiocManager")

#BiocManager::install("msa")
#devtools::install_bitbucket("Grantlab/bio3d-view")
```

```{r}
#library(bio3d)

#aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
#aa
```
Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 
214.
